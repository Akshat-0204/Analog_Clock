Analog Clock Project

A simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Hour, minute, and second hands are updated in real-time
Clock face is designed using CSS, with a beige background and a circular shape

How it Works

The project uses the following technologies:

HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the clock face and hands
CSS: Used to style the clock face and hands, including colors, shapes, and sizes
JavaScript: Used to update the hands of the clock in real-time, using the setInterval function to call the clock function every second
The clock function gets the current time using the Date object, and then calculates the rotation of each hand based on the current time. The rotation is then applied to each hand using the style.transform property.
